# Validation

Every gate currently active in this repository, with its exact scope. There
is no reactor-capability validation because no reactor capability exists;
these gates validate the repository infrastructure and the truthfulness of
its architecture-only state.

## Local gates

| Gate | Command | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | `ruff check .` | all Python under `tools/` and `tests/` |
| Format | `ruff format --check .` | same scope |
| Typing | `mypy --strict tools tests` | zero errors, strict mode |
| Tests + coverage | `pytest -q --cov=tools --cov-branch --cov-fail-under=100` | 100 % statement and branch coverage of `tools/` |
| Domain manifest | `python3 tools/validate_reactor_domain.py reactor-domain.json` | schema, registry version/digest (the prepared release `1.1.0` against the family map's pending block), exact configuration set including the namespaced extension identifier, empty capability/claim inventories, safety boundary |
| Studio descriptor | `python3 tools/derive_studio_descriptor.py --check` | committed descriptor byte-identical to a fresh derivation |
| Capability inventory | `python3 tools/generate_capability_inventory.py --check` | committed inventory byte-identical to a fresh generation |
| Licensing | `reuse lint` | REUSE 3.x compliance of the full tree |
| Workflow lint | `actionlint` | all files under `.github/workflows/` |
| Workflow modularity | `python3 tools/audit_workflows.py` | distributed workflow inventory: single ownership per job, coordinator/gate contract, action pinning, size ceilings |
| Documentation | `python3 tools/preflight.py --only docs` | UTF-8 readability and relative-link integrity of every Markdown file |
| Orchestrated | `python3 tools/preflight.py` | fail-closed run of all gates above |

The pre-commit chain additionally runs REUSE compliance, a typographical
checker (`_typos.toml`), the commit-trailer guard (seat and authorship
lines, no legacy co-author trailer, no outward superlatives), and the
upstream YAML, TOML, large-file and private-key guards.

## Workflow gates

Definitions are present in-repository; they run on the hosted platform
only once a remote exists under separate owner authority.

The hosted surface is modular: `ci.yml` is a coordinator that carries
only trigger policy, two reusable-workflow calls, and one stable
fail-closed `gate` job aggregating every category (failure,
cancellation, and unexpected skips all fail the gate). Every job is
declared and owned exactly once in the versioned inventory
`.github/workflow-inventory.json`, which the workflow-modularity guard
verifies locally and in hosted CI.

| Workflow | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | coordinator and stable required gate |
| `reusable-static-policy.yml` | lint, format, typing, domain policy, workflow guard |
| `reusable-tests.yml` | tests with complete statement and branch coverage |
| `pre-commit.yml` | exact pre-commit parity |
| `codeql.yml` | Python code scanning |
| `security-audit.yml` | secrets, dependency, licence, and workflow policy |
| `docs.yml` | strict documentation and link validation, no deployment |
| `sbom.yml` | reproducible dependency inventory, no release |
| `scorecard.yml` | read-only supply-chain analysis |

## Shared ecosystem gate

From the monorepo root:

```bash
python3 agentic-shared/scripts/repository_tier0_scaffold_audit.py \
  03_CODE/SCPN-REACTOR-SYSTEMS/repositories/SCPN-LATTICE-FUSION-CORE --json
```

proves the Tier-0 local-scaffold machine profile (required and forbidden
paths, Git/remote boundary, workflow pins and permissions, badge non-claims,
JSON integrity, defensive ignore rules).
